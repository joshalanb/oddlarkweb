#### Some extra details
Humanoib is a game that explores a singular
concept:
##### “**Character Creation as Gameplay**”

**Snap**, **Combine** and **Plop** body parts onto your creations (named **Noibs**) and send them off to compete against other weirdos in
“**Flesh-Child Beauty Pageants**” to gain **MAXIMUM APPROVAL** from your **Dad, The Universe**.

**Edit** and **Refine** your unique **Noib** to do battle against other creations from around the **Universe**, then use your winnings to purchase new body parts to further improve your little guy for the next **Contest**.

The core of the game is an accessible, console friendly indie **Creature Creator** featuring **Asynchronous Multiplayer**, **Strategic Depth** and **Procedural-ish Physics-y Slapstick Comedy**.
